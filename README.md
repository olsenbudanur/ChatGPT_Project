# What is TutanaAI?

TutanaAI was a website that allowed you to use OpenAI's davinci_003 model to write custom college essays. This was done by allowing the users to input a couple of prompts which were later sent to the OpenAI's davinci_003 API. 

TutanaAI was written in React.js, and Express.js. It used Firebase for authentication, Stripe for handling payments, and Vercel for CI/CD & Deployment.
